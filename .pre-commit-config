# Python oriented pre-commit
#
# Note that the check-yaml argument does not work
#
# so only single document in a yaml file is allowed
# tried dockerfilelint but too strict and disabling does not work

# python regex syntax for inclusion
# https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp
# So this means only look at python files
#files: ".py$"
# This is only for python and other files
# This means exclude directories ./typescript
#exclude: "typescript|golang"
